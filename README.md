# Budding
A Shopping Cart Project for Earbud Cases

"This is a fresh project I've been coding since jumping into Node and Express. Here are some of my acquired skills:

- Collaborating with a group, exchanging and adapting ideas.
- Escaping the confines of "tutorial hell" by developing this project.
- Distinguishing between environment and production variables and placing them appropriately to bolster project security (although I need to enhance this knowledge).
- Utilizing Nodemailer to dispatch emails to other recipients (but I'm uncertain if it's production-ready üò¢).
- Coordinating with teammates who have been assigned designated roles.
- Communicating with cloud databases (services) like MongoDB Atlas.
- Deploying backend APIs via platforms such as Render.
- Constructing intricate models or documents utilizing mongoose (although I need to hone this ability)."

Ps. I had a lot of fun working with my brother on this project üòÅ
